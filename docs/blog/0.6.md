# Rill 0.6 – Introducing radically simple dashboards

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL, design metrics, and explore line charts and create powerful, opinionated dashboards. These are our release notes for the `0.6` release, still in Tech Preview.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](https://docs.rilldata.com/#pick-an-install-option) and [let us know over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) if you encounter any problems or have ideas about how to improve Rill Developer!

No more complex BI tools - our interactive dashboards are incredibly easy to set up. With thoughtful, opinionated defaults you can start deriving insights from your data faster than ever.  

## Radically simple dashboards
Ever since our first `0.1.0` release, we've had countless people in the community ask us if we were planning to tie in more data visualization & exploration tools. `0.7.0` marks our first foray into viz tools that leverage our data modeling functionality, starting with the simple drilldown dashboard bundled directly into Rill Developer. The dashboard tool enables you to define measures and dimensions on top of models, then provides a fast, powerful, opinionated way to drill down into your dimensions to uncover new trends.

Why start here? We know intimately that people basically hate building and maintaining dashboards. Something that seems so useful ends up becoming stale, untouched, and unloved over time. We think this is because too much responsibility is placed on the analyst to _design_ the dashboard, rather than _design_ (and govern) the metrics. And because they're often backed by data warehouses instead of databases designed to be fast, they're cumbersome and joyless to use. It doesn't have to be this way!

Our first version of the Rill dashboard is, let's just say, _pretty fresh_. We set an aggressive timeline so we could start learning about what is working and what isn't, as well as getting feature requests from the people that are using Rill Developer today. But we think it has some of the same reactive magic as our modeling tool.

A dashboard has these three components:



- **Line charts —**  Data visualizations of aggregated measures are reactively updated as dimension values are brought in and out of focus using filters.
- **Leaderboards —** Leaderboards surface the top 7 values for each dimension to quickly identify big segments for each measure.
- **Filters —** Dynamic filters on measures help you focus on different patterns within the same data set. Our dashboard allows you to focus on different periods of time using the time selector and focus on specific combinations of dimension values using leaderboard filters.


## Design metrics for people
To complement the dashboard is our new Metrics Designer tool. It helps you summarize data models into interpretable metrics for your dashboard. The metrics designer lets you quickly assign a time series, pick drilldown dimensions, and create measures using aggregate SQL expressions. In addition, human readable definitions for metrics and dimensions are connected and discoverable.

Like our dashboard, this is a first pass. We'd love to hear from you about what is and isn't working!


- **Measures and dimensions definitions —** Definitions that are discoverable and tied to analytics logic logic help dashboard users interpret what they are seeing.
- **Human readable —** Upstream data work is often done by machines that need to read well-structured strings. However, this is not ideal for people to interpret in dashboards. Rill Developer lets you set a label in place of model column name and format the output to humanized numbers.
- **Automated quick start —** Automated quick start saves you time by setting all `VARCHAR` type columns as dimensions and setting `COUNT(*)` as your first measure.

We don't quite feel we've nailed the user flow of data-to-dashboard, but the point of this release is to get it into your hands. Stay tuned for some user flow refinements!
