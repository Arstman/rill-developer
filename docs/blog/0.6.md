No more complex BI tools - our interactive dashboards are incredibly easy to set up. With thoughtful, opinionated defaults you can start deriving insights from your data faster than ever.  

## Radically simple dashboards
In this release of Rill Developer we bring a new level of speed and simplicity to interactive metrics dashboards. To date, Rill Developer has focused on data modeling with profiling to help you transform raw resources into analytics-ready data models. Our new dashboards further transform these models into insights using aggregated measures and dimension drilldowns displayed in line charts and leaderboards.


- **Line charts —**  Data visualizations of aggregated measures are reactively updated as dimension values are brought in and out of focus using filters.
- **Leaderboards —** Leaderboards surface the top 7 values for each dimension to quickly identify big segments for each measure.
- **Filters —** Dynamic filters on measures help you focus on different patterns within the same data set. Our dashboard allows you to focus on different periods of time using the time selector and focus on specific combinations of dimension values using leaderboard filters.


## Design metrics for people
Rill's Metrics Designer helps you summarize data models into interpretable metrics for your dashboard. The metrics designer lets you quickly assign a timeseries, pick drilldown dimensions, and create measures using aggregate SQL expressions. In addition, human readable definitions for metrics and dimensions are connected and discoverable.

- **Measures and dimensions definitions —** Definitions that are discoverable and tied to analytics logic logic help dashboard users interpret what they are seeing.
- **Human readable —** Upstream data work is often done by machines that need to read well-structured strings. However, this is not ideal for people to interpret in dashboards. Rill Developer lets you set a label in place of model column name and format the output to humanized numbers.
- **Automated quick start —** Automated quick start saves you time by setting all `VARCHAR` type columns as dimensions and setting `COUNT(*)` as your first measure.
